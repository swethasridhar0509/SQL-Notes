- DBMS is a software that lets users interact with the DB. **Ex:** MySQL and PostgreSQL.
- **Key features:**
    - **Data management** - quick inserts, updates, and deletes.
    - **Data retrieval** - allows for data query much faster than a spreadsheet.
- **Types:**
    - Relational Databases.
    - NoSQL Databases.

## Database Management Systems

- DBMS is a software that manages database structures and lets users perform data manipulation operations.
- **Key features:**
    - **Data Organization** - Structures data into tables, documents, and key-value pairs.
    - **Data Security** - Implements access control and encryption for data protection.
    - **Concurrency control** - Allows multiple users to access data without conflict.

## Relational Databases

- Relational databases structure data into separate tables with relationships.
- **Rows** - an item in a set.
- **Column** - an attribute of the item.

## Structured Query Language (SQL)

- SQL is the standard language used to interact with Relational Databases.
- It is used to:
    - Create database structures like tables, views, and indexes.
    - manage data.
    - It is a query language. i.e., It can be used to ask questions about data in the database.
- SQL syntax comprises commands, clauses, and operators.
- SQL dialects / Subsets - part of SQL standard adapted by various DBMS.

## SQL Syntax

- Termination character - ;
- single quotes to enclose string.
- SQL is case-insensitive.
- Use double hyphen (- -) for single-line comments.
- Use /**/ for multi-line comments.
- Reserved words should not be used as Identifiers.
- Identifiers can contain alphabets and underscore.
